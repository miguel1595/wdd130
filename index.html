            <p>"Hello! My name is Miguel Gordillo, and I'm from Lima, Peru. I enjoy learning about technology and I love
            music. I'm currently studying Software Development at BYU. I'm excited to learn and grow in this field.
            I'm especially interested in software development and how technology can improve everyday life. I enjoy
            listening to rock music, riding my bike around the city, and watching movies in my free time. I'm also
            passionate about building creative digital solutions. I'm married, and I value spending quality time with my
            family.
            I am very curious by nature, and I like to understand how things work behind the scenes, especially in web
            development and app design. One of my goals is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to meaningful
            projects that solve real-world problems. I also enjoy exploring new programming languages and frameworks in
            my spare time.
            When I am not coding, I like to relax by going on bike rides along the coast of Lima or spending time
            listening to music, especially classic and alternative rock. Watching science fiction or tech-themed movies
            is another thing I love. I believe that technology, creativity, and teamwork can build amazing things.I'm
            constantly looking for ways to improve my skills, whether it's through online courses, tutorials, or
            personal projects. Being part of the BYU community has helped me stay motivated and focused on my goals. I am
            excited for the opportunities this field offers and can not wait to keep learning and creating..".</p>
